# Hi there, I'm Willian Pripp 👋

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Analyst | SOC & SIEM Specialist | Automation Engineer

I am a passionate **Cybersecurity Analyst** with 4+ years of experience in **Security Operations Centers (SOC)** and **Managed Detection and Response (MDR)** environments. My core expertise lies in building robust defense mechanisms using the **Elastic Stack (SIEM)**, automating incident response workflows with **Python** and **PowerShell**, and developing strategic detection rules to mitigate real-world threats.

I focus on reducing **Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)** through intelligent automation and providing actionable insights via custom dashboards.
